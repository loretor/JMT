# New feature for [Java Modelling Tools](https://jmt.sourceforge.net/)

For security and privacy reasons, I am unable to share the current version of JMT.

## Scope of the new feature
The new feature enhances the existing JMCH tool within JMT. JMCH is a Modelling classroom helper for learning queueing theory through animations.

The feature aims to help new users understand the differences between various queue and routing policies through animations. 
The user can modify certain model parameters, such as inter arrival time distributions, service time distributions, traffic intensity, etc., to understand how each change impacts the parameters associated with the model, like throughput, response time, queue time, etc.
