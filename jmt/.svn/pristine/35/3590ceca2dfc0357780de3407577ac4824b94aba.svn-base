	<h1>Installation notes</h1>
	It is recommended to UNINSTALL any previous version of Java Modelling Tools present on your PC before installing this new release.

	<h2>What's new in version 1.2.4</h2>
	<h3>JSIMgraph</h3>
	<ul>	
		<li>Soft deadlines (soft deadlines) and related measures (Earliness, Tardiness, Lateness).</li>
		<li>New scheduling policies with deadlines (EDD, EDF).</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Working folder</h2>
	<br>
	A JMT working folder will be created in the home directory of the user to store examples and working files.
	For example, the files created by the Loggers (xxx.csv files) are by default located in this folder.
	The location of the working folder depends on the operating system:
	<ul>
		<li>Linux: /home/<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>/JMT</li>
		<li>Windows: C:\Users\<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>\JMT</li>
		<li>Mac OS X: /Users/<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>/JMT</li>
		<!--<li>on Windows XP the working folder is C:\Documents and Settings\<i>&lt;user name&gt;</i>\JMT</li>-->
			</ul>
	In older JMT versions, the default working folder was the JMT installation path.
	<!--If you have stored some JMT models there, we suggest you to move them in the new working folder.-->
	
	<h2>Keeping updated</h2>
	New JMT versions are released at:http://jmt.sourceforge.net
